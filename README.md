# Logistic Regression Challenge

# Project Description 

## Step 1: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Create the labels set "y" from the loan_status column and create the features "X" DataFrame from the remaining columns.
- Split the data into training and testing datasets using train_test_split.

## Step 2: Create a Logistic Regression Model
- Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
- Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using X_test and the fitted model.
- Evaluate the model's performance by generating a confusion matrix, generating a classification report, and answering how well the logistic regression predicts the healthy and high-risk loan labels. 

## Step 3: Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
- Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis.
- Describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model, and summarize the results from the machine learning model and include any justification for recommending/not recommending the model to the company.
